Final project for Unit 1 of Data Data Analytics and Python Course-Savvy Coders
The assignment for my final project in Python was to input a directory into a Python console and rename all the files in the directory. 
I used the user's current directory and inputed that filepath to change all the names of the files in the current directory using os modules from Python.
